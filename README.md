[![Docs](https://github.com/Sustainable-Solutions-Lab/food-opt/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://sustainable-solutions-lab.github.io/food-opt/)

food-opt is a global food-systems optimization model built on [PyPSA](https://pypsa.org/) and [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io). It explores environmental, nutritional, and economic trade-offs through a configuration-driven mixed integer linear program build by reproducible workflow.

ðŸš§ This project is currently **under construction**! ðŸš§

Documentation is kept up to date at a best effort basis. Certain model elements are still missing. Validation of model results has not yet been conducted. Expect frequent breaking changes.

## Documentation

Documentation (model design, configuration reference, data provenance, API) lives under `docs/`; the documentation is built automatically by a Github Action and, for now, can be accessed by clicking the documentation badge at the top of this page.

## Quickstart

To install, clone the git repository and make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.

In order to build the model, you will first have to download a few datasets manually. See the documentation for details. Then you are ready to run the model:

```bash
uv sync
tools/smk -j4 --config name=test
```

- `tools/smk` wraps Snakemake with the repositoryâ€™s resource limits and environment pins.
- Snakemake targets land under `results/{name}/`.

## Repository Layout

- `workflow/` â€“ Snakemake rules and scripts, including the top-level `workflow/Snakefile`.
- `config/` â€“ Scenario YAMLs and shared fragments that parameterize the workflow.
- `docs/` â€“ Sphinx documentation sources (see `docs/README.md` for dev tips).
- `tools/` â€“ Helper wrappers such as `tools/smk` for consistent CLI entry points.
- `results/` â€“ Generated artifacts grouped by configuration (never hand-edit).

Additional contribution guidance can be found in the documentation; dataset provenance is tracked in `data/DATASETS.md`.
