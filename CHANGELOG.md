# Changelog

All notable changes to GLADE are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the model remains under active development (pre-1.0), minor releases may
introduce breaking changes to configuration and outputs.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- FAOSTAT bulk data is now fetched from a pinned Zenodo mirror (the GLADE
  input-data mirror, shared with the land-cover extract) instead of FAO's
  unversioned bulk endpoints, so re-downloads can no longer silently change
  the data vintage and fresh clones reproduce the calibrated baseline. The
  record is pinned by the new `data.mirror.zenodo_record` config key (which
  replaces `data.land_cover.zenodo_record` and participates in calibration
  provenance, so a vintage bump forces recalibration); maintainers refresh
  the mirror to a new FAO release with `tools/mirror_faostat.py`.

- Production anchoring is now done by exactly calibrated convex
  piecewise-linear supply curves (new `market_response` configuration
  section), replacing the L1 `deviation_penalty` as the default mechanism.
  Each production group -- including multi-cropping bundles -- gets a
  marginal-cost curve through its observed activity whose slope reproduces a
  configured own-price supply elasticity, so response to a shock is graduated
  and its strength follows from an elasticity assumption rather than from a
  fitted deviation target. The curves calibrate exactly by the standard
  two-phase positive-mathematical-programming procedure: a new
  `market_response` calibration step (one baseline-pinned solve, replacing the
  L1 `stability` step in the `tools/calibrate` chain) writes each group's
  price wedge to `market_response.csv`, and solves feed the wedges back as
  curve intercepts, reproducing the observed allocation as the exact
  unconstrained optimum -- no hard constraints, no tuned deviation target.
  The spatial resolution of the curves is configurable (`granularity`); the
  default is per production link, which prices spatial reallocation and makes
  the per-link deviation penalty redundant, and per-country or per-region
  curves are available where a coarser anchor is wanted. The curve cost
  appears as its own `market_response` category in the objective breakdown.
  The deviation-penalty machinery remains available for configs that
  re-enable it, and its artefacts stay in the calibration sets; configs on
  the `gbd-anchored` set need `tools/calibrate --base <config>
  market_response` before solving with the curves. See "Market Response" in
  the configuration reference and the calibration documentation.

- The same mechanism now calibrates the demand side: a `demand` component
  (enabled by default) gives every (food, country) consumption link a concave
  marginal-utility curve through its observed intake, with the willingness to
  pay fitted sequentially against the calibrated supply curves and the curve
  stiffness governed by per-food-group own-price demand elasticities
  (`market_response.elasticities.demand`, central values from the Green et
  al. 2013 meta-regression). Ordinary solves previously had no
  demand-side valuation at all unless a config enabled the consumer-values /
  piecewise-utility mechanism; the demand component replaces that pattern (the
  two are mutually exclusive, and `food_utility_piecewise` remains available
  for configs that keep it, with `market_response.components.demand: false`).
  The demand curves' cost appears as its own `demand_response` category in the
  objective breakdown.

- Multiple cropping is now anchored to an observed baseline derived from
  MIRCA-OS v2 (new automated data source), using the available 2010, 2015, or
  2020 release nearest `baseline_year`. A fixed, documented sequence catalog
  replaces dynamic combination discovery. Config entries may disable catalog
  sequences or add zero-baseline greenfield potential under a new name.
  Irrigated and rainfed observations are attributed separately, competing
  rotations share crop-area budgets, and outputs are derived per config so the
  spatial and climate inputs cannot be mixed between runs.
  `crop_production_multi` links participate in the land deviation penalty, crop
  growth cap, cost calibration, and validation-mode pinning like single-crop
  links. Harvested cycles are reconciled out of the single-crop FAOSTAT
  baselines so each cycle is counted once. A new `multi_crop_cost.csv`
  calibration artefact carries per-(combination, country) bundle corrections.
  The GAEZ growing-season compatibility gate is removed; observed feasibility
  comes from MIRCA plus the GAEZ multiple-cropping zone.

- New `health.segment_formulation: relax_and_fix` option (now the default):
  a two-pass LP scheme for the health module's non-convex dose-response
  curves (solve the relaxation, pin each non-convex curve to the segment of
  its relaxed intake, re-solve warm-started) with a certified optimality gap
  checked against `health.relax_and_fix_max_gap`. If the certificate fails,
  the solve re-fixes the segments from the repaired solution and, as a last
  resort, automatically falls back to the exact sos1 MIP seeded with the
  repaired solution, instead of erroring. Health-enabled solves no
  longer contain integer variables: full-resolution scenarios solve with the
  open-source HiGHS solver in about 5 minutes (`solving.options_highs:
  {solver: ipm, run_crossover: on}`, no Gurobi license required) and about
  30% faster than before under Gurobi, with results that agree across
  solvers and certify tighter than the previous 0.1% MIP gap. The exact MIP
  indicators remain available via `health.segment_formulation: sos1`.
- Interactive **Carbon Price Dial**: a web widget embedded in the
  documentation where GHG-price and value-per-life-year sliders drive live
  land-use maps, net-emissions, system-cost and diet readouts by evaluating
  the MLP surrogate directly in the browser. Includes constant- and
  flexible-diet modes, a grams/kcal diet toggle, per-region hover breakdowns
  of cropland and grazing land, and an advanced panel exposing the remaining
  surrogate inputs.
- New `mlp` surrogate method (now the default) with optional seed-ensemble
  averaging and per-target loss weighting, plus PCA-compressed spatial-field
  surrogate outputs that reconstruct per-region land-use maps. Surrogate
  modelling is documented on a dedicated docs page
  (`docs/surrogate_modelling.rst`).
- Calibration artefacts are now organized in per-config **sets** under
  `data/curated/calibration/<source>/`, selected via the new
  `calibration.source` config key. Each set carries a `provenance.yaml` stamp
  of the structural config it was calibrated against; workflow runs error on
  structural mismatch (downgradable via
  `calibration.accept_provenance_mismatch`). `tools/calibrate --base <config>`
  calibrates a dedicated set for a structurally divergent config.
- New alternative baseline-diet source `diet.source: fbs`, derived from
  **FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheets**: per-country food supply energy at
  model-basis densities, corrected for consumer waste. The default remains
  the GDD-IA source. No calibration artefact set is shipped for the FBS diet,
  so using it requires running `tools/calibrate` against your config first
  (see `docs/calibration.rst`).
- New `diet.anchor_groups_to_gbd` option that decouples GBD anchoring of the
  baseline diet's risk-factor food groups from the health module. Defaults to
  the sentinel `match_health` (follow `health.enabled`); set `true`/`false` to
  control it independently. Previously anchoring was unconditional. See
  `docs/current_diets.rst` for a quantitative description of the difference and
  the refined-grain caveat. The baseline diet feeds calibration, so a
  `gbd-anchored` artefact set (the previous GBD-anchored artefacts) is
  committed alongside `default` and consumed by the health-enabled configs via
  `calibration.source: gbd-anchored`. Provenance stamps record the *resolved*
  anchoring, and `tools/calibrate` pins the base config's resolved anchoring
  across all five calibration steps.

### Changed

- The validation configs (`config/validation.yaml`,
  `docs/config/doc_validation.yaml`) and both tutorial configs under
  `config/tutorial/` now leave the health module off, so they run without the
  manually-downloaded IHME GBD data. Their baseline diet is consequently no
  longer anchored to GBD intake exposure and they consume the `default`
  calibration artefact set, which shifts validation figures somewhat. Turn
  health back on with `health.enabled: true` plus
  `calibration.source: gbd-anchored`.

- `tools/calibrate --check` now answers by content instead of by file
  timestamp. Each artefact set carries a `fingerprint.yaml` hashing the step's
  external inputs (curated, bundled and manually downloaded data, the rule
  files and scripts its DAG runs, and its config), so `git checkout`, `touch`
  and comment-only config edits no longer report anything, and re-running one
  step no longer marks its successors stale. New `tools/calibrate --record`
  re-stamps a set without solving, for when a code change provably cannot move
  the artefacts.

- `config/default.yaml` now has the canonical name `default`. All shipped
  configuration fields are validated as required; workflow code no longer
  supplies hidden fallback values for missing keys.
- `planning_horizon` now defaults to 2020, matching `baseline_year`, so an
  unmodified run solves the observed year the calibration artefacts are fit
  against. Configs that previously relied on the 2030 default (including
  `gsa.yaml`, `gsa_fixed_diet.yaml` and `example.yaml`) now solve at 2020
  population and GDP levels; set `planning_horizon: 2030` explicitly to keep
  projecting demand forward. The calibration, validation, tutorial and
  documentation configs no longer restate the year, as it now matches the
  default.
- Cost calibration is fit against the base config's water model. It
  previously pinned `water.data.availability: current_use` regardless of the
  configuration it was calibrating, so every artefact set carried cost
  corrections fit under a different water system than the one they were
  applied in, while `provenance.yaml` recorded the base config's setting. The
  shipped cost corrections shift by 3-12%; configurations that resolve water
  seasonally with AWARE scarcity tiers, where the water system actually binds,
  shift by around 30%.
- MIRCA-OS monthly calendar grids are now packed into one shared sparse
  preprocessing artefact and reuse exact region-cell coverage across crops.
  Repeated configuration builds avoid decoding the same dense global NetCDF
  grids, substantially reducing calendar build time and peak memory without
  changing its output.
- Spatial preprocessing and model construction now reuse region/class cell
  mappings, bound raster cache memory, and vectorize repeated aggregation and
  crop-link operations. This substantially reduces the time and peak memory
  needed to build a default model without changing its contents.
- Crop-yield and harvested-area preparation now compute exact region and
  resource-class cell coverage once per configuration and reuse it across
  crops, substantially reducing build time and peak memory without changing
  outputs.
- **The water system has been rebuilt on a consumption basis.** Irrigation
  previously drew from a single per-region growing-season store sized from
  Huang et al. withdrawals. It now draws from a regional pool anchored on
  WaterGAP 2.2e irrigation consumption, through a per-region delivery link
  whose efficiency `eta_c` is calibrated at build time against observed
  consumption, with availability and scarcity characterised by AWARE 2.0. The
  three water quantities the literature conflates (crop net requirement,
  consumption, withdrawal) are now distinct and separately reported. New
  automatic downloads: AWARE 2.0 and WaterGAP 2.2e (ISIMIP3a). The Water
  Footprint Network "sustainable" supply scenario and the
  `water.supply_scenario` key are removed, along with the WFN availability
  download/processing pipeline and its documentation figure; the source is now
  `water.data.availability` (`aware` or `current_use`), defaulting to `aware`.
  **This is a results-affecting default change** — the AWARE pool is a looser
  constraint than the previous binding present-day withdrawal cap.
- Water supply and demand can be resolved at **intra-year periods**
  (`water.temporal_resolution`, a divisor of 12), so a season whose surface
  cannot meet its demand draws groundwater endogenously instead of being
  rescued by annual averaging. Crop water demand is placed into periods by the
  observed MIRCA-OS irrigated crop calendar, retimed to WaterGAP's monthly
  requirement. **The default is 1 (annual), which is cheap but has a
  consequence worth stating plainly: at annual resolution the groundwater bands
  are nearly inert and reported depletion falls to near zero — an artefact of
  the resolution, not a finding.** Studies about water should raise it.
- Surface water and renewable groundwater are characterised as **one AWARE
  renewable resource**: each basin's CF curve spans the joint envelope
  (WaterGAP surface delivery plus renewable groundwater) and is split at the
  basin's surface fraction — the lower slice is period-bound surface, the
  upper slice becomes annual per-region renewable-groundwater CF bands. This
  replaces the earlier draft's flat renewable-groundwater band at the region's
  scarcest surface CF, which saturated at the AWARE cutoff (CF 100) almost
  everywhere and drifted with the temporal resolution. Groundwater is always
  part of the aware supply (the `water.supply.groundwater` switch is removed;
  cap mining at solve time via `groundwater_depletion.cap_mm3: 0` for a
  mining-free system); the `current_use` source emits no groundwater bands,
  since its observed-withdrawal pool already contains groundwater. Irrigation's
  share of the groundwater-storage depletion trend is attributed by its share
  of all-sector potential groundwater consumption (new WaterGAP `ptotusegw`
  download), so basins mined by municipal or industrial pumping no longer
  zero irrigation's renewable band. Water supply fidelity remains a single
  switch, `water.supply.scarcity_tiers` (convex AWARE scarcity curves, default
  off — each pool is one flat availability cap). Scarcity pricing or capping
  requires it and raises otherwise, since with collapsed curves there is no
  scarcity signal to price.
- New optional solve-time levers, both off by default: `water_scarcity`
  (pricing and/or capping accumulated AWARE scarcity) and
  `groundwater_depletion` (pricing and/or capping accumulated mining). With
  `water_scarcity.nonrenewable_cf` set, mined groundwater is charged at that
  CF under scarcity pricing *and* counts CF-fold against a scarcity cap (a
  joint constraint), so neither lever can be satisfied by free substitution
  into fossil groundwater. Analysis gains a `water_metrics` output with
  per-region withdrawal, scarcity, renewable groundwater and depletion.
- Model regions are now built **basin-aware**: GADM provinces are first split
  along AWARE hydrological basin boundaries, and each country is partitioned
  into regions balancing geography against basin scarcity
  (`aggregation.regions.basin_scarcity_weight`, default 2.0; 0 recovers the
  previous purely geographic clustering). A province straddling an abundant and
  a scarce basin is no longer pooled into one region, which used to average away
  exactly the sub-provincial scarcity that constrains irrigation. Every region
  is still either contained in one province or a union of whole provinces, so
  regions remain comparable to political units. The
  `aggregation.regions.allow_cross_border` option is removed; regions never
  cross country borders. **This changes default region geometry for
  every config**, so all `processing/` artefacts are rebuilt and the tracked
  calibration sets must be regenerated. Requires the AWARE2.0 basin geopackage
  (new automatic download).

- The **GDD-IA baseline-diet dataset is now retrieved automatically** from
  Zenodo ([10.5281/zenodo.20818140](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20818140),
  CC-BY-4.0) instead of being obtained on personal request and placed under
  `data/manually_downloaded/`. It is now published as Springmann, M., *Global
  dietary estimates for conducting health, environmental and economic impact
  assessments*, Nature Food (2026),
  [doi:10.1038/s43016-026-01388-z](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-026-01388-z),
  and should be cited as such. The data is unchanged, so results are
  unaffected; any GDD-IA CSVs under `data/manually_downloaded/` are now
  ignored and can be deleted. The record ships 1990-2020 in five-year steps;
  for intervening `baseline_year` values the workflow warns and uses the
  closest release. Retrieving it needs no account, so a default build now
  requires no manually-downloaded data at all.
- Tightened the default solve memory allocation (`solving.mem_mb`) to match
  the reduced memory usage of full-resolution solves.
- Reformulated the **L1 deviation penalties** (production, animal-feed, diet
  stability) from an absolute-value auxiliary variable with two inequality
  rows per link to an equivalent equality split into non-negative
  positive/negative deviation parts, and priced the zero-baseline
  land-conversion penalty directly on link flows. Together with a faster
  nodal-balance construction in the vendored PyPSA fork, this cuts
  full-resolution solve times by roughly a third (about 40% fewer
  constraint rows after presolve) with identical optima up to solver
  tolerance.
- Improved the optimisation model's **numerical conditioning** to remove
  Gurobi's "large matrix coefficient range" warning. The CH₄ and N₂O emission
  buses are now denominated in kilotonnes (previously tonnes) so their flow
  coefficients sit within a few orders of the CO₂ bus, and a new `numerics`
  config block clips physically-negligible coefficients at build time
  (sub-hectare areas, trace irrigation/carbon fluxes, rounding-level cost
  corrections). The former `land.filtering` thresholds now live under
  `numerics`. Emission totals and the objective are unchanged (to within
  solver tolerance); only reported CH₄/N₂O bus flows change units.
- Whole-grain definitions are aligned across diet sources: a new `maize-whole`
  food carries GBD's whole-grain exposure in maize-staple regions,
  `diet.fbs.whole_grain_shares` is refit against GBD per-country whole-grain
  exposure, and GDD-IA cereal energy is re-split by each country's FBS cereal
  composition (fixing starved whole-grain intake for Sahel coarse-grain
  staples). Both calibration artefact sets are refreshed accordingly.
- The health module is now **disabled by default** (`health.enabled: false`).
  With health off, the workflow no longer requires the manually-downloaded
  IHME GBD data and runs end to end without it; a clear startup error is
  raised if health (or GBD anchoring) is enabled but the data is absent.
- A default build now requires **no credentials**: land-cover data is fetched
  from a CC-BY-4.0 Zenodo mirror instead of the Copernicus Climate Data Store
  (dropping the CDS API key), and the USDA FoodData Central key is only needed
  when refreshing nutrition data (`data.usda.retrieve_nutrition: true`, off by
  default; the bundled `data/curated/nutrition.csv` is used otherwise).
- Upgraded the vendored solver stack: linopy to `v0.8.0+glade2` (CSR-based
  matrix construction, frozen constraint storage) and PyPSA to
  `v1.2.0+glade2` (vectorized dual assignment). Together these cut solver
  matrix assembly by ~60x and dual recovery from ~470 s to ~2 s on
  full-resolution solves.

### Removed

- The MARS surrogate method; supported surrogates are now `pce`, `rf`, `xgb`
  and `mlp`.
- Unused configuration keys `health.ssb_sugar_g_per_100g`,
  `data.gaez.climate_model_ensemble`, and
  `sensitivity_analysis.default_surrogate`. Surrogate methods are selected
  explicitly in target and bundle names. Sensitivity scenarios must use the
  separate `food_loss` and `food_waste` factors instead of the removed
  `food_loss_waste` convenience key.

### Fixed

- Enforced biofuel and industrial demand for vegetable oils no longer draws
  more of the oil than FAOSTAT reports. The demand links deflated the food-bus
  draw by the source crop's moisture content, which is not the moisture of the
  commodity the food bus carries: palm oil was drawn at 2.5 times its reported
  non-food use (95 against 38 Mt globally), and soybean and rapeseed oil at
  about 1.1 times. Palm oil consequently ran a 26 Mt global shortage that the
  food-demand calibration absorbed by clipping its multiplier at the configured
  floor. Ethanol demand is unchanged. `biofuel_baseline.csv` and
  `biogas_crop_demand.csv` gain a `dm_mt` column carrying the dry matter
  delivered to the biomass bus alongside the source-bus draw.

- `docs/config/doc_figures.yaml` no longer pins `water.data.availability` to
  `current_use`, which contradicted the `gbd-anchored` calibration artefacts it
  consumes and aborted every documentation build on the provenance check.
  Documentation figures now use the default AWARE water supply, and the
  regional water availability map reports annual renewable availability, the
  quantity both availability sources provide.

- The feed, food_waste, food_demand and cost calibration steps no longer depend
  on the calibrated deviation penalty, which the stability step produces at the
  end of the chain. The first three pin production to actuals, so the penalty
  had nothing to act on; the cost step drives production stability through hard
  bounds, which never read the calibrated L1 costs. Regenerating the artefact
  sets confirms the dependency was inert: every artefact is unchanged. The
  calibration chain is a strict forward pass again, and
  `tools/calibrate --check` settles after a full run instead of reporting the
  first four steps stale.

- Workflow startup no longer builds a full copy of the configuration for every
  configured scenario when deciding whether health data is needed. On configs
  with generated scenario ensembles this dominated DAG construction: for
  `gsa.yaml` (16384 samples) Snakefile parsing drops from ~35 s to ~4 s, and
  every Snakemake invocation against such a config benefits.

- Solve-time calibration artefacts (feed corrections, exogenous feed and
  forage, food-demand multipliers, the calibrated deviation penalty) are now
  declared as inputs of `solve_model` and `calibrate_deviation_penalty`, so
  Snakemake reruns solves when they change.

- The feed calibration step no longer consumes the food-waste calibration
  artefact, which is produced by a later step in the chain. Feed was
  effectively fit against whichever vintage happened to be on disk, a full
  chain could never reach a fixed point, and `tools/calibrate --check`
  reported the feed step permanently stale. Feed-side artefacts move by
  0.1-0.2%.

- Fixed a GAEZ data artefact where a handful of cells carry a negative net
  irrigation requirement, which flipped those crop links into spurious water
  *producers*. Negative requirements are now clipped to zero.
- Baseline biofuel/industrial and biogas demand is enforced again. Since
  2026-05-20 the crops-with-supply safety check in `add_biofuel_links` ran
  before any crop production links existed, so every build silently dropped
  the entire fixed biofuel demand (~290 MtDM globally: maize and sugarcane
  ethanol plus palm, soybean and rapeseed oil). Baseline solves still looked
  right because production-stability anchoring mimics the demand, but under
  strong price signals (water or carbon pricing) the model could simply
  abandon bioenergy crops instead of meeting their demand. Models must be
  rebuilt for the fix to take effect; results solved on affected builds
  understate pressure on bioenergy feedstocks.
