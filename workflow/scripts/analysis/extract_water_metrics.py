"""Extract AWARE water-scarcity metrics from solved networks.

The tiered water supply (carrier ``water_supply``) converts a free source bus
into regional water (bus1 = ``water:{region}``) and tallies scarcity onto
``impact:water_scarcity`` via ``efficiency2`` = the tier's marginal
characterisation factor (CF, m3 world-equivalent per m3). Drawing the link
(``p0`` > 0) therefore both supplies irrigation water and accumulates scarcity.

Tiers carry a ``source``: ``renewable`` (surface) and ``groundwater_renewable``
tiers accumulate AWARE scarcity via ``efficiency2`` = the marginal CF (the
latter additionally tally their drawn volume on
``impact:groundwater_renewable``), while ``groundwater_nonrenewable`` tiers
accumulate mined volume 1:1 on ``impact:groundwater_depletion`` (their
``efficiency2`` is 1, not a CF). This module reads those links to report, per
region and in total:
- withdrawn irrigation volume (Mm3), all sources,
- accumulated water scarcity (Mm3 world-equivalent) = sum(CF * draw) over
  CF-carrying (surface + renewable groundwater) tiers,
- the volume-weighted mean CF of the CF-carrying water drawn,
- renewable groundwater volume (Mm3) from ``groundwater_renewable`` tiers,
- non-renewable groundwater depletion (Mm3 mined) from
  ``groundwater_nonrenewable`` tiers.

Basis: the tier draw is *consumption* C -- crops need their net requirement E
and the ``irrigation_delivery`` link draws ``C = E / eta_c`` from the pool.
``withdrawn_mm3`` therefore reports consumption; the estimated physical
withdrawal is ``withdrawal_reported_mm3 = withdrawn_mm3 / consumed_fraction``
with the consumed fraction (C/W) stashed in ``n.meta`` at build time.

Units: the produce-link identity ``m3/ha * Mha = Mm3`` means tier draws and
the scarcity tally are already in Mm3 and Mm3-world-eq (see the AWARE design
note); no scale factor is applied here. The global scarcity and depletion
stores (``store:impact:water_scarcity`` / ``store:impact:groundwater_depletion``)
equal ``scarcity_mm3_eq`` / ``groundwater_depletion_mm3`` summed over regions,
modulo solver tolerance.
