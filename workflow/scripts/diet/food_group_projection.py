"""Within-group pooled-projection helpers for baseline-diet attribution.

Defines the per-(food_group, GAEZ-module) pools of FAOSTAT FBS item
codes that ``estimate_baseline_diet`` redistributes across the modelled
foods in each pool, weighted by a per-country/global blended crop-
production share. The same blend is used on the supply side by
``harvested_area_shares`` so demand and supply within-group splits stay
symmetric (see comment block below for the full rationale).

# Demand-side projections that mirror the supply-side GAEZ-RES06 module
# attribution. Each (food_group, module) pool collects all FBS item codes
# whose food maps onto the module, and splits the pooled supply across the
# module's modelled foods by per-country/global crop-production share.
#
# Pooling explicit FBS codes alongside any FBS "Other" residual is what
# makes the demand split symmetric with the supply split. On the supply
# side, each modelled food in a module receives both its FAOSTAT direct
# area and a share of the module's residual raster area. If demand
# instead routed an explicit FBS supply (e.g. onion FBS 2602) entirely to
# one food, the within-module shares would diverge from supply: one food
# absorbs all explicit demand while supply spreads across the module,
# producing systematic per-food slack even when the group balances.
#
# Examples:
#   * OVG (vegetables): onion FBS 2602 + "Vegetables, other" FBS 2605
#     are pooled and split across {onion, cabbage, carrot} (cabbage and
#     carrot have no explicit FBS code; FAOSTAT lumps them under 2605).
#     Tomato is excluded — it has its own TOM raster and its own
#     FBS 2601, so its demand routes via the explicit-supply path.
#   * BAN (fruits): plantain FBS 2616 projects onto banana, matching
#     supply where banana's BAN raster already absorbs plantain area.
#     Banana FBS 2615 stays explicit because banana has its own raster
#     and own FBS code (same shape as tomato).
#   * FRT (fruits): citrus codes (2611-2614), apple FBS 2617, plus the
#     unmodelled-fruit residuals (FBS 2618 pineapples, 2619 dates, 2625
#     "Fruits, other") are pooled and split across {citrus, mango,
#     watermelon, apple}. Mango and watermelon have no explicit FBS
#     code; FAOSTAT lumps them under 2625.
#
# Grapes (FBS 2620) are intentionally excluded: although the FBS "Food"
# element is in principle net of wine processing, most of the world's
# grape harvest enters the alcohol industry which the model does not
# treat as fruit consumption and which GBD's fruits risk factor excludes.
