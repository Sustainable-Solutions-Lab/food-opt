"""Generate the curated dietary RR age-attenuation table (one-off).

The IHME Burden-of-Proof tool only serves age-aggregated ("All Ages") dietary
relative-risk curves. GBD applies age-specific RRs for cardiovascular outcomes
(the proportional effect attenuates with age); diabetes and colorectal cancer
carry no age attenuation. We reconstruct that age structure once and freeze it
into a curated table used by the per-build workflow.

Method
------
The log-RR age attenuation is multiplicative and essentially exposure-independent:

    log RR_age(x) ~= beta(age) * log RR_ref(x)

Per the GBD 2021/2023 risk-factors capstone appendix, GBD assigns the estimated
(MR-BRT / Burden-of-Proof) risk curve to a *reference age group* -- the median
age-at-event across cohorts, 60-64 years for the cardiovascular age trend (the
same trend is applied to dietary CVD outcomes) -- and derives age-specific RRs
by attenuation relative to it. The Burden-of-Proof tool's "All Ages" curve is
therefore the 60-64 reference-age curve. We mirror that exactly: take the GBD
2019 age shape and normalize it to the 60-64 reference,

    beta(risk, cause, a) = log RR(a) / log RR(60-64)

so age-expanding the BoP curve reproduces it at 60-64, attenuates to older ages,
and amplifies to younger ages, as GBD does. T2DM and CRC carry no age
attenuation (beta = 1).

(Caveat: GBD attenuates *excess* risk, RR - 1, with a percentage-change form in
GBD 2023, whereas we attenuate log-RR. Because beta is measured from GBD's
*published* age-specific curves -- which already bake in that attenuation -- and
we only re-set the reference age, the functional-form difference is second-order.)

Provenance: age shape is indirect from the GBD 2019 RR appendix; the 60-64
reference age is GBD's documented choice. Our own derived result, not a
redistribution of GBD RR values.
