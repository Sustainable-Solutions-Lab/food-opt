# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents contributing to this repository.

## Purpose

Provide clear expectations and a safe, efficient workflow so agents can make small, correct, and reversible changes that fit the project’s conventions.

## Project Overview (brief)

- Global food systems optimization using linear programming.
- Built on PyPSA for modeling and Snakemake for workflow orchestration.
- Configuration-driven; results materialized under `results/{config_name}/`.

## Filesystem Layout

- `config/`: Scenario configuration files and shared YAML fragments; edits here drive what Snakemake targets construct and solve.
- `data/`: Source datasets and mock CSVs used for testing; treat contents as inputs only and keep large/raw data out of Git.
- `docs/`: Sphinx documentation (17 sections covering all model aspects); see `docs/README.md` for build instructions.
- `workflow/`: Snakemake project root with the main `workflow/Snakefile`, modular rules, and workflow scripts under `workflow/scripts/`.
- `tools/`: Utility wrappers (e.g., `tools/smk`) that pin resource limits and interpreter settings for repeatable runs.
- `processing/`: Intermediate datasets that feed the modeled workflow.
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analyses and sanity-check visualisations.
- `results/`: Auto-generated artifacts organized as `results/{config_name}/`; never hand-edit. Rerun the relevant target instead.
- `tests/`: pytest integration tests using the Snakemake Python API; run via `pixi run -e dev test`.
- `vendor/`: Local clones of our custom PyPSA and linopy forks. The build pins them by git tag in `pixi.toml` (e.g. `linopy v0.8.0+glade`), but these clones are where fork development and testing happen -- see "Developing the vendored forks" below.

The paper manuscript and its figure notebooks live in a separate repo at `../paper/` (sibling of this one). Those notebooks import from `workflow/` via `sys.path` and read from `results/` here — see `../paper/notebooks/README.md` for the exact configs and Snakemake targets each figure depends on. Do not re-add a `paper/` submodule or reintroduce `notebooks/paper_figures/` here.

## Model Structure

The model represents global food systems as a PyPSA network where commodities flow through a supply chain from land/resources to human nutrition. The `build_model` rule (in `workflow/rules/model.smk`) orchestrates construction via `workflow/scripts/build_model.py`, which calls functions from the modular `workflow/scripts/build_model/` package.

### Supply Chain Overview

Key commodity flows:
- **Land → Crops**: Production links consume land (Mha) and produce crops (Mt) with yields as efficiency
- **Crops → Foods**: Processing pathways convert crops to foods with mass-balance factors
- **Foods → Nutrition**: Consumption links route foods to nutrient stores and food-group stores
- **Crops/Foods → Feed**: Conversion links supply animal feed categories
- **Feed → Animal products**: Animal production with emissions and manure outputs
- **Trade**: Hub-based networks enable commodity movement between countries

The model also tracks supporting resource flows: regional irrigation **water** availability and consumption, synthetic **fertilizer N** supply with manure recycling, crop **residues** routed to feed or soil, and **biomass** export to the energy sector.

### Emissions Tracking

GHG emissions flow to global buses (`emission:co2`, `emission:ch4`, `emission:n2o`) that aggregate to `emission:ghg` using configurable GWP factors:

| Source | Gas | Mechanism |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Land-use change | CO₂ | Efficiency on `land_conversion` links (LUC carbon coefficients) |
| Spared land | CO₂ | Sequestration credits on `spare_land` links (negative emissions) |
| Rice cultivation | CH₄ | Efficiency on wetland rice production links (IPCC emission factors) |
| Enteric fermentation | CH₄ | Efficiency on `animal_production` links (from feed digestibility) |
| Manure management | CH₄ | Efficiency on `animal_production` links (country-specific factors) |
| Synthetic fertilizer | N₂O | Efficiency on `fertilizer_distribution` links (direct + indirect) |
| Manure application | N₂O | Efficiency on `animal_production` links (pasture + applied fractions) |
| Residue incorporation | N₂O | Efficiency on `residue_incorporation` links (from residue N content) |

The `emission:ghg` store accumulates total CO₂-equivalent emissions for use in optimization objectives and constraints.

### Module Organization

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `infrastructure.py` | Carriers, buses for crops/foods/feeds/nutrients per country |
| `land.py` | Land buses, existing/new land generators, land-use-change emissions |
| `primary_resources.py` | Water, fertilizer supply, emission aggregation buses |
| `crops.py` | Crop production links, multi-cropping, spared land, residue incorporation |
| `grassland.py` | Grassland/pasture feed production |
| `food.py` | Crop→food conversion pathways, feed supply links |
| `animals.py` | Feed→animal product conversion with CH₄/N₂O emissions |
| `nutrition.py` | Food→nutrient/group links, stores for nutritional tracking |
| `trade.py` | K-means hub networks for crop/food/feed trade |
| `health.py` | Health impact stores by disease cluster |
| `biomass.py` | Biomass export routes for crops and byproducts |

### PyPSA Component Patterns

**Multi-bus links** (the workhorse of this model):
- `bus0`: Primary input (e.g., land in Mha)
- `bus1`: Primary output; `efficiency` = output/input ratio
- `bus2`, `bus3`, …: Additional inputs/outputs with `efficiency2`, `efficiency3`, …
  - Positive efficiency → output; negative → input (relative to `bus0`)

**Adding components**: PyPSA auto-expands scalar arguments, so use `marginal_cost=1` instead of `[1] * len(...)`.

### Naming Conventions

Names use `:` as delimiter. Pattern: `{type}:{specifier}:{scope}`

| Component | Pattern | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Buses** | | |
| Crops/foods | `{type}:{item}:{country}` | `crop:wheat:USA`, `food:bread:USA` |
| Feed | `feed:{category}:{country}` | `feed:ruminant_grain:USA` |
| Nutrients | `nutrient:{nutrient}:{country}` | `nutrient:protein:USA` |
| Land (cropland) | `land:cropland:{region}_c{class}_{water}` | `land:cropland:usa_east_c1_r` |
| Land (pasture) | `land:pasture:{region}_c{class}` | `land:pasture:usa_east_c1` |
| Water | `water:{region}` | `water:usa_east` |
| Emissions | `emission:{type}` | `emission:co2`, `emission:ghg` |
| **Links** | | |
| Production | `produce:{crop}_{water}:{region}_c{class}` | `produce:wheat_rainfed:usa_east_c1` |
| Processing | `pathway:{pathway}:{country}` | `pathway:milling:USA` |
| Consumption | `consume:{food}:{country}` | `consume:bread:USA` |
| Animal | `animal:{product}_{feed}:{country}` | `animal:beef_grassfed:USA` |
| Trade | `trade:{item}:{from}_to_{to}` | `trade:wheat:USA_to_hub0` |
| **Stores** | `store:{type}:{item}:{scope}` | `store:group:cereals:USA` |
| **Generators** | `supply:{type}:{scope}` | `supply:land_existing:usa_east_c1_r` |

### Carrier and Metadata Columns

**IMPORTANT**: Never parse component names. Always use columns for filtering.

The `carrier` column identifies link/component type:
- `crop_production`, `crop_production_multi`, `grassland_production`
- `food_processing`, `food_consumption`, `feed_conversion`
- `animal_production`, `trade_crop`, `trade_food`, `trade_feed`
- `land_use`, `land_conversion`, `spare_land`

Domain-specific columns for filtering:
- `country`, `region`: Geographic scope
- `crop`, `food`, `food_group`: Commodity type
- `product`, `feed_category`: Animal production
- `resource_class` (int), `water_supply` ("irrigated"/"rainfed"): Land characteristics

### Accessing Components

Always filter by carrier and metadata columns, never by parsing names:

```python
# Get crop production links for wheat in a country
wheat_links = n.links.static[
    (n.links.static["carrier"] == "crop_production") &
    (n.links.static["crop"] == "wheat") &
    (n.links.static["country"] == "USA")
]

# Get all food consumption links
consume_links = n.links.static[n.links.static["carrier"] == "food_consumption"]

# Get stores for a food group
group_stores = n.stores.static[n.stores.static["carrier"] == f"group_{group}"]
```

Fail fast when components are missing:
```python
if group_stores.empty:
    raise ValueError(f"No stores found for food group '{group}'")
```

### Units

| Quantity | Unit | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Land area | Mha | Megahectares (10⁶ ha) |
| Commodities | Mt | Megatonnes (fresh weight for foods, dry matter for crops) |
| Water | Mm³ | Million cubic meters |
| Fertilizer N | Mt N | Megatonnes nitrogen |
| Emissions | t CO₂/CH₄/N₂O | Tonnes (aggregated to GHG via GWP factors) |
| Costs | bn USD | Billion USD (marginal_cost per unit of bus0 flow) |

See `workflow/scripts/build_model/__init__.py` for the complete reference.

## Core Principles

- This project is currently unstable and under rapid development; never implement any kind of backward compatibility.
- Keep code concise: Prefer simple control flow; fail early on invalid external inputs.
- Do your best to avoid over-engineering. If you see possibilities for simplifying, suggest improvements (but let the user approve of such drive-by refactors first).
- Consistent style: Follow existing patterns in nearby files; don’t introduce new paradigms ad hoc.
- Comments (code and config alike) describe the *current* state as helpfully as possible, and only where something is not self-explanatory. Never write comments that justify a change or contrast with previous behaviour ("previously X", "default flipped to Y", "used to be unconditional") — that history belongs in the commit message.
- Reproducibility: Use the Snakemake targets below to validate changes; don’t hand‑run ad hoc pipelines unless necessary.
- No unused imports: The linter removes them automatically; only add imports when adding code that uses them.
- ASCII-only in code, comments, and docstrings: ruff's `RUF001`/`RUF002`/`RUF003` rules flag ambiguous Unicode look-alikes (`×`, `–`, `—`, `’`, `…`, `Σ`, `≈`, non-breaking spaces, etc.) and block pushes via the pre-push hook. Use plain ASCII substitutes: `*` for multiplication, `-` for dashes, `'` for apostrophes, `~=` for approx-equal, spell out Greek letters. Math notation in docstrings is the most common offender — write `sum over i of a_i * b_i`, not `Σ_i a_i × b_i`.
- Do not add `from __future__ import annotations`; type checkers and tooling already expect
  runtime string annotations, so this import is unnecessary and should be avoided.
- Documentation-first interfaces: If you change a script’s inputs/outputs, update inline docstrings and any referenced docs/config keys.
- Never use `config.get(<attr>, <default>)` or similar with a hardcoded default value in any script; we always assume that the configuration is well-formed and complete, so we can just index directly (`config[<attr>]`).

## Environment & Tooling

- Dependency manager: `pixi` (see `pixi.toml`).
- Lint/format: `ruff` for Python, `snakefmt` for Snakemake files (auto-enforced via hooks; no manual action usually needed).
- Workflow engine: `snakemake` (run via `tools/smk` wrapper by default).

### Developing the vendored forks (linopy / PyPSA)

`pixi.toml` pins `linopy` and `pypsa` to git tags on our forks
(`koen-vg/linopy`, `koen-vg/PyPSA`), e.g. `linopy = { git = ..., tag =
"v0.8.0+glade" }`. We keep `+glade` tags that are upstream releases plus a small
set of GLADE-specific commits (for linopy: MIP fixed duals and `_mip_start`).

The standard procedure when changing a fork (e.g. bumping linopy to a new
upstream release and rebasing our commits onto it) is:

1. Work in the local clone under `vendor/<fork>/` (it has its own git remotes:
   `origin` = our fork, `upstream` = the original project). Rebase/cherry-pick
   our `+glade` commits onto the new upstream tag on a fresh branch, and run the
   fork's own test suite there (linopy uses `uv`: `uv sync --extra dev` then
   `.venv/bin/python -m pytest`).
2. Install the local clone into the GLADE pixi env **temporarily** to test the
   integration before publishing a tag:
   `pixi run -e dev pip install -e vendor/linopy --no-deps --no-build-isolation`.
   Iterate and run GLADE's tests against it.
3. Once it checks out, push the branch and a new `vX.Y.Z+glade` tag to our fork,
   update the `tag = ...` pin in `pixi.toml`, and run `pixi install` to refresh
   `pixi.lock` to the new commit. Commit `pixi.toml` + `pixi.lock` together.

Because the pin and lock reference an exact remote commit, the tag must be
pushed before `pixi install` can relock against it. Do fork work in a separate
git worktree so it doesn't disturb a checkout being used for other work.

### Available Environments

- `default`: Base environment with HiGHS solver (open-source)
- `dev`: Development tools (Jupyter, Sphinx, prek, etc.)
- `gurobi`: Includes Gurobi solver (requires license)
- `dev-gurobi`: Development tools + Gurobi solver

Recommended commands (use the memory-capped wrapper):

```bash
# Install and sync dependencies (default environment)
pixi install

# Install with Gurobi solver support
pixi install --environment gurobi

# Install development environment
pixi install --environment dev

# Run the full workflow (data prep → build → solve)
tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml

# Run with specific environment
tools/smk -e gurobi -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml

# Build model only (scenario-independent, shared across all scenarios)
tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml -- results/{config_name}/build/model.nc

# Solve model only (after build)
tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml -- results/{config_name}/solved/model_scen-default.nc

# Build the docs, including figures
tools/build-docs -j4

# Test small snippets of code
pixi run python <...>
```

Notes:

- Remember the double dash (--) before any target file, to separate flags from the target file.
- **Scenario wildcard**: Solve, analysis, and plot targets include a `{scenario}` wildcard (e.g., `model_scen-default.nc`). The build step is scenario-independent (`build/model.nc`), and scenario overrides are applied at solve time. Scenarios must only override solve-time keys (see `SOLVE_TIME_CONFIG_PREFIXES` in `workflow/rules/common.smk`); structural keys must be set at the base config level.
- Snakemake tracks code changes and will rerun affected rules; manual cleanup of workflow artefacts is unnecessary. You almost never have to use the `--forcerun` argument.
- Prefer small, testable edits and validate by running the narrowest target that exercises your change.
- `tools/smk` runs Snakemake in a systemd cgroup with a hard 10G cap and swap disabled by default; override with `SMK_MEM_MAX=12G tools/smk ...`. When `SMK_MEM_MAX` is set, it is also forwarded to Snakemake as a global `mem_mb` resource limit for scheduling. It also implements the `-e <environment>` flag to select the pixi environment.
- Retrieval / downloading rules and scripts make network calls; when running such rules you will need to ask for permission to run outside the sandbox in order to get network access.
- Never rerun retrieval rules without explicitly being instructed to do so. This includes implicit calls like an indiscriminate use of the `--forceall` Snakemake argument.

### HPC Cluster Workflow

For large-scale runs (e.g., GSA with ~12k scenarios), solves are executed on an HPC cluster **without Snakemake** to avoid DAG construction overhead and filesystem latency. The workflow uses a manifest-based approach:

1. **`tools/export-solve-manifest`** (local): Generates a JSON manifest containing fully-resolved inputs, params, and outputs for each scenario. This mirrors the logic in the `solve_model` / `solve_and_analyze_model` Snakemake rules but runs independently.
2. **`tools/sync-solve-inputs`** (local): Syncs built model, processing files, manifest, and scripts to the cluster.
3. **`tools/batch-solve`** (cluster): Submits SLURM array jobs that call `tools/cluster-solve` per scenario.
4. **`tools/cluster-solve`** (cluster): Reads a manifest entry, constructs a lightweight namespace shim, and calls `run_solve` / `run_analysis` directly — no Snakemake imports.

**Important**: When adding or changing inputs/params on the `solve_model` or `solve_and_analyze_model` rules, you **must** also update `tools/export-solve-manifest` to include the same inputs/params in the manifest. The manifest generator is intentionally decoupled from Snakemake for performance (13s vs ~5min via the Snakemake API for ~12k scenarios). See the comments on the rules in `workflow/rules/model.smk` and `workflow/rules/analysis.smk`.

See `docs/cluster_execution.rst` for full documentation.

## Testing

Integration tests live in `tests/` and use pytest with the Snakemake Python API. They exercise the full workflow pipeline using a lightweight configuration (`tests/config/test.yaml`) with reduced spatial resolution and a small crop subset, outputting to `results/test/`.

### Test Configuration

- **`tests/config/test.yaml`**: 200 regions, 2 resource classes, 9 crops, 14 trade hubs. Overrides `default.yaml`.
- **`tests/config/test_scenarios.yaml`**: Two scenarios (`default` and `G`) — enough to exercise the scenario mechanism and GHG pricing.

### Running Tests

```bash
pixi run -e dev test              # all tests
pixi run -e dev test-integration  # dryrun + build/solve/analysis only
pixi run -e dev test-no-plots     # skip plot generation tests
pixi run -e dev pytest -v         # verbose output
```

### Test Markers

| Marker | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `integration` | Full Snakemake workflow tests (dryrun + build/solve/analysis) |
| `plots` | Figure generation tests (optional, slower) |

### Notes

- The **dryrun test** (`test_workflow_dryrun`) validates full DAG construction with `forceall=True` without executing any rule. It makes no API calls; the manually-downloaded source files must be present for the DAG to resolve. See `.github/workflows/test.yml` for how CI stages them.
- The **execution test** (`test_build_solve_analyze`) runs the actual pipeline and downloads public input data on first run (network access required).
- Tests never delete `results/test/` or `.snakemake/`; Snakemake detects up-to-date outputs and skips them automatically. Subsequent runs are near-instant when code hasn't changed.
- New unit tests go in `tests/test_*.py` alongside integration tests.

## Repository Conventions

- Scripts used by the workflow live in `workflow/scripts/`.
- Configuration lives under `config/` (e.g., `config.yaml`).
- Input data under `data/`; outputs under `results/` (structured by config name).
- Don’t commit large data or generated results; `.gitignore` and the workflow manage these.
- If you are working on incorporating a new dataset, check that the dataset is documented in `docs/data_sources.rst`.

### Git guidelines

- AI Agents (Claude, Codex, etc) should not add themselves as co-authors to commits unless explicitly asked for.
- Do not include AI session links (e.g. `Claude-Session:` trailers or `claude.ai/code` URLs) in commit messages, PR descriptions, or issues — even if the agent harness suggests adding them.
- Use commit messages in `<type>: <imperative summary>` format (e.g., `fix: handle empty scenario list`).
- Prefer one of these types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `tests`, `chore`, `perf`.

### Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` (rendered in the docs via `docs/changelog.rst`) follows the Keep a Changelog format; new entries go under `## [Unreleased]` in the appropriate `Added`/`Changed`/`Fixed`/`Removed` subsection.

- Add an entry for anything a user of the model would notice: new features, changed config keys or defaults, changed model behaviour or outputs, bugfixes that affect results, removed functionality, major performance improvements, and dependency or setup changes.
- Skip entries for internal refactors, test/CI-only changes, documentation-only changes, and trivial fixes with no user-visible effect.
- Write for users, not developers: describe the observable change and any migration needed, not the implementation. Fold related commits or PRs into a single entry.

## Calibration

Five calibrations feed the default workflow. Their outputs are organized
in per-config artefact *sets* under `data/curated/calibration/<source>/`
(selected by the `calibration.source` config key; git-tracked sets, both
fit against the default GDD-IA diet source: `default` -- fit against the
anchoring-off baseline diet -- and `gbd-anchored` -- fit against
`config/gbd_anchored.yaml`, the default config with the GBD-anchored
diet as its only structural change, consumed by the health-enabled
configs) and builds depend on them. When upstream data or build logic changes materially,
regenerate in this order:

1. **feed** — `config/calibration/feed.yaml` → `grassland_yield.csv`,
   `fodder_conversion.csv`, `exogenous_forage.csv`,
   `exogenous_feed.csv`.
2. **food_waste** — `config/calibration/food_waste.yaml` →
   `food_waste.yaml` (per-food-group consumer-side waste multipliers).
3. **food_demand** — `config/calibration/food_demand.yaml` →
   `food_demand.csv` (per-food global multiplier on baseline-diet
   `target_mt`, applied in `_match_baseline_to_consume_links` at solve
   time).
4. **cost** (legacy production anchoring) — `config/calibration/cost.yaml` → `crop_cost.csv`,
   `grassland_cost.csv`, `animal_cost.csv`. Step 1 of the cost solve
   now enables hard production-stability bounds at +/-20% with a
   `slack_marginal_cost: 5.0` override for foods carrying structural
   FAOSTAT-vs-FBS mismatch beyond the band.
5. **market_response** - `config/calibration/market_response.yaml` ->
   `market_response.csv` (per-group production intercepts and, when enabled,
   demand intercepts plus their slope-price basis). Production and demand are
   fit sequentially; the sentinel `market_response.intercepts: "calibrated"`
   resolves this artefact at solve time. Entries are keyed by curve group, so
   link-granularity intercepts are specific to the exact model structure.

Production anchoring is strictly exclusive: the default workflow uses
`market_response.enabled: true` and `cost_calibration.enabled: false`.
Configurations that consume the legacy cost corrections must set
`market_response.enabled: false` before enabling `cost_calibration`; JSON
Schema validation rejects both active at once. Calibration generation may set
`cost_calibration.generate: true` while leaving `enabled: false`.

The legacy **stability** step (`config/calibration/stability.yaml` →
`deviation_penalty.yaml`, the calibrated L1 penalty costs) is no longer
part of the default chain; run `tools/calibrate stability` explicitly
for artefact sets still consumed by deviation-penalty configs.

Single entrypoint: `tools/calibrate` (`all` by default; `feed`,
`food_waste`, `food_demand`, `cost`, `market_response`, `stability`, or
`--check` for staleness). `tools/smk` prints a one-line reminder when
`data/curated/` inputs are newer than the oldest calibration artefact.

Each artefact set carries a `provenance.yaml` stamp of the structural
config it was fit against (written by `tools/calibrate`); every workflow
run checks its config against the stamp of the set it consumes and
errors on structural mismatch. Configs with different structural
assumptions must declare their own `calibration.source` and run
`tools/calibrate --base config/<name>.yaml`, or set
`calibration.accept_provenance_mismatch: true` (test/tutorial configs
only). See `docs/calibration.rst` for the full story.

## Configuration Validation

The project uses automatic configuration validation via JSON Schema to ensure all config files are complete and well-formed.

### How It Works

- **Schema location**: `config/schemas/config.schema.yaml` (JSON Schema in YAML format)
- **Automatic validation**: Runs at the start of every Snakemake workflow execution via `workflow/validation/config_schema.py`
- **Based on**: `config/default.yaml` structure; all fields in default are generally required
- **User configs**: Only need to specify overrides; they're merged with default before validation
- **Scientific notation**: PyYAML 6.0+ parses scientific notation like `1e-2` as strings. Use decimal notation (`0.01`) instead.

## Secrets Management

API credentials are kept out of the main configuration and out of version control, and each is tied to one specific task.

Credentials can be supplied either in `config/secrets.yaml` (copy `config/secrets.yaml.example`; the file is gitignored) or via environment variables, which take precedence. They are loaded in `workflow/validation/secrets.py` and merged into `config["credentials"]`.

- **USDA FoodData Central key** (`USDA_API_KEY`, or `credentials.usda.api_key`): the one build-time credential, read by the `retrieve_usda_nutrition` rule when `data.usda.retrieve_nutrition: true`. That rule raises a clear error if the key is absent. Get a free key at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html.
- **Copernicus CDS credentials** (`ECMWF_DATASTORES_URL` / `ECMWF_DATASTORES_KEY`) and **Zenodo token** (`ZENODO_TOKEN`): used by `tools/mirror_land_cover.py` to refresh the land-cover data mirrored on Zenodo, which regular builds fetch from that mirror.

## When Implementing Changes

- Keep function/module scope tight; avoid broad rewrites.
- Mirror existing error handling: validate external data; trust internal invariants.
- Add or adjust docstrings where behavior or parameters change.
- If you add a new rule or script, integrate it into the `workflow/Snakefile` and ensure targets are reproducible.
- Don’t introduce network calls or external services in core code unless explicitly required by the task.

## Documentation

- Comprehensive Sphinx documentation lives in `docs/` with 17 major sections covering:
  - Model framework, components, and mathematical formulation
  - Data sources, workflow execution, and configuration
  - All model aspects: land use, crops, livestock, nutrition, health, environment
  - Contributing guidelines, API reference
- When adding features or changing behavior, update relevant documentation sections in `docs/*.rst`.
- Build docs locally: `cd docs && make html` (requires `pixi install --environment dev`).
- Documentation is version-controlled and builds automatically on ReadTheDocs.
- **No in-page tables of contents**: the Furo theme renders a sidebar ToC on every page and explicitly rejects in-page `.. contents::` directives (it injects a red error block into the rendered HTML). Rely on Furo's sidebar and on section headings; do not add `.. contents::` to any `.rst` file.

### Documentation Figures

**Important**: Documentation figures are **NOT tracked in git**. They are:
- Generated locally via Snakemake using `docs/config/doc_figures.yaml` and `docs/config/doc_validation.yaml`
- Uploaded to a GitHub Release (tag: `doc-figures`)
- Referenced in `.rst` files via GitHub release URLs
- Located in `docs/_static/figures/*` (ignored by `.gitignore`)

When updating documentation figures:

```bash
# 1. Generate figures (handles both validation and regular configs)
tools/build-docs -j4

# 2. Upload to GitHub release (requires gh CLI authentication)
tools/upload-doc-figures

# 3. Commit any .rst changes (not the figures)
git add docs/*.rst
git commit -m "Update documentation figures"
```

`.rst` files always contain remote GitHub release URLs. When building docs locally,
`conf.py` has a `source-read` hook that transparently rewrites these to local
`_static/figures/` paths if the local figures directory exists. No manual URL
switching is needed.

**Never** commit figure files (`*.png`, `*.svg`) to git - they are hosted externally to keep the repository lean.

## Validation Checklist

- Narrow target runs clean via Snakemake for at least one `config_name`.
- Integration tests pass: `pixi run -e dev test-integration` (at minimum, the dryrun test should pass).
- No new linter errors; no unused imports.
- Results land under the expected `results/{config_name}/...` path(s).
- Documentation updated when changing user-visible behavior (check `docs/*.rst` for relevant sections).

## Safety & Licensing

- Respect SPDX headers; keep or add them to new files following repository practice.
- Do not introduce secrets, credentials, or hard-coded local paths.
- Use only licensed datasets and dependencies already declared in `pixi.toml` unless explicitly instructed to add new ones.

## Available Project Subagents

Project-specific Claude subagents live in `.claude/agents/` and currently include:

- `flow-auditor`: Trace data lineage, units, and missing-data handling across preparation, build, solve, and analysis.
- `model-reviewer`: Review PyPSA and solve-time correctness, especially balances, signs, units, and slack semantics.
- `docs-sync`: Detect and fix drift between implementation and documentation.
- `results-sanity-checker`: Inspect solved outputs and analysis for plausibility and anomaly triage.
- `test-gap-finder`: Identify the smallest high-value additions to test coverage.

When a task clearly matches one of these roles, prefer delegating to the relevant subagent early.

## Scratchpad

A shared scratchpad lives at `.claude/scratchpad.md` for semi-ephemeral notes that help agents get up to speed quickly. Unlike AGENTS.md (authoritative, stable) this file captures working knowledge: gotchas, surprising behaviors, recent pitfalls, useful one-liners, etc.

### Rules

- **Read on start**: At the beginning of every session, read `.claude/scratchpad.md` if it exists.
- **Update as you go**: Whenever you discover something non-obvious (a tricky API quirk, a data-quality issue, a Snakemake subtlety, a debugging trick), append or update the scratchpad.
- **Keep it short**: Target ≤ 80 lines. When it grows too long, prune entries that are stale, already encoded in AGENTS.md, or no longer relevant. Prefer terse bullet points over prose.
- **No secrets or paths**: Same rules as the rest of the repo — no credentials, no machine-specific absolute paths.
- **Not version-controlled**: The file lives under `.claude/` which is gitignored. It is local working memory, not documentation.

### Suggested format

```markdown
# Scratchpad

## Gotchas
- <one-liner about a surprising behavior>

## Useful commands
- <handy invocations worth remembering>

## Current state / WIP context
- <anything about the repo's current state that a fresh session should know>
```

## Reminder

Againt, always remember to use pixi to run snippets of python; do not run python directly or you won't be able to use any project dependencies.
