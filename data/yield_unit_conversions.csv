# Per-crop yield unit conversions for GAEZ potential yields.
#
# GAEZ documentation notes unit inconsistencies:
# - Most crops: kg dry weight per hectare (→ t/ha factor = 0.001).
# - Alfalfa, miscanthus, napier grass, reed canary grass (and pasture grasses/legumes):
#   units are in 10 kg dry weight per hectare (→ t/ha factor = 10 / 1000 = 0.01).
# - Sugar beet and sugarcane: kg sugar per hectare (use 0.001 to convert to t sugar/ha).
# - Olive and oil palm: kg oil per hectare (use 0.001 to convert to t oil/ha).
# - Cotton: kg lint per hectare (use 0.001 to convert to t lint/ha).
#
# This table overrides the per-crop conversion to t/ha used when aggregating yields.
# Column definitions:
# - code: GAEZ crop code (as used in file names and Snakefile wildcards)
# - factor_to_t_per_ha: multiply raw raster value by this factor to obtain t/ha
# - note: optional human-readable note
