# Crop-to-food conversion pathways
#
# Each pathway transforms one crop into one or more food products.
# Multiple pathways for the same crop represent alternative processing options.
# The model will choose which pathways to activate based on demand and costs.
#
# Conversion factors should sum to â‰¤ 1.0 per pathway (mass balance with losses).
# Sources are primarily from FAO Nutrient Conversion Table for SUA (2024), sheet 03.
#
# Columns:
# - pathway: unique identifier for the processing pathway
# - crop: input crop name (must match config crops list)
# - food: output food product name
# - factor: conversion factor (mass of food output per unit mass of crop input)
# - description: explanation of the conversion and source reference
