# Feed properties database for crops and food byproducts used as animal feed
#
# Feed categories:
#   - forage: High-fiber forages (grassland, silage, hay-type crops)
#   - concentrate: Energy/protein concentrates (grains, oilseeds, pulses)
#   - byproduct: Processing byproducts (brans, meals, hulls)
#
# Units:
#   - digestibility: fraction of feed converted to animal product (0-1)
#   - ME_MJ_per_kg_DM: Metabolizable energy in MJ per kg dry matter
#   - CP_pct_DM: Crude protein as percentage of dry matter
#   - NDF_pct_DM: Neutral detergent fiber as percentage of dry matter

# Digestibility values are MOCK and should be replaced with actual feed conversion efficiencies
# Nutritional values (ME, CP, NDF) are placeholders for future use
