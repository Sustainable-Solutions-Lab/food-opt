Calibration
===========

The default workflow relies on several separate calibrations that each
transform outputs of a dedicated solve into a git-tracked input consumed
by every subsequent solve. Running ``tools/calibrate`` regenerates them
all in the right dependency order; individual steps can also be run
directly.

Calibration artefacts are organised in *sets*: one directory
``data/curated/calibration/<source>/`` per base configuration they were
calibrated against, selected by the ``calibration.source`` config key.
The shipped ``default`` and ``gbd-anchored`` sets are version-controlled
so that ordinary builds don't need to re-solve anything. See
:ref:`calibration-provenance` for how sets are tied to configs.

.. admonition:: Calibration is tied to the baseline diet (and thus to diet source, health and anchoring)
   :class: warning

   Several artefacts (notably ``food_demand.csv``, ``food_waste.yaml``
   and ``deviation_penalty.yaml``) are fit against a *specific* baseline
   diet. The baseline diet depends on the diet source (``diet.source``:
   GDD-IA or FBS-derived; see :ref:`current-diets-fbs-source`) and on
   whether the GBD risk-factor groups are anchored to GBD intake, which
   is controlled by ``diet.anchor_groups_to_gbd`` (default: follow
   ``health.enabled``); see :ref:`current-diets-gbd-anchoring`.

   Two artefact sets are committed, both fit against the default GDD-IA
   diet source and differing only in anchoring: ``default``, fit against
   the anchoring-off diet of the default config; and ``gbd-anchored``,
   fit against the GBD-anchored diet and consumed by the health-enabled
   configs (``gsa``, ``doc_figures``) via
   ``calibration.source: gbd-anchored``. No set is shipped for
   ``diet.source: fbs``: that source is supported but needs its own
   calibration run before use. ``tools/calibrate`` resolves anchoring
   from its base config and pins it across all five steps, so each set
   is regenerated against the right diet automatically. The provenance
   stamps record the diet source and the *resolved* anchoring, so
   consuming a set fit against a different diet fails at startup.

.. _calibration-enabled-generate-pattern:

.. note::

   **Canonical configuration pattern.** Every calibration section has two
   flags: ``enabled`` controls whether the calibration is *applied* at
   solve/build time, and ``generate`` controls whether the workflow
   *produces* the calibration file from a source scenario. The canonical
   pattern for generation is ``enabled: false, generate: true`` so that
   ``enabled`` is the single source of truth at runtime. The alternative
   (``enabled: true, generate: true``) is rejected by
   ``workflow/validation/calibration.py`` to keep configurations
   unambiguous. The same validator also checks that the named source
   ``scenario`` is defined under ``config["scenarios"]`` when
   ``generate: true``, and that referenced calibration files exist on
   disk when ``enabled: true, generate: false``.

Dependency order
----------------

When upstream data or build logic changes, rerun in this order:

#. :ref:`feed <calibration-feed-step>` — other calibrations solve against a
   model whose feed slack is already closed by the forage and protein
   corrections.
#. :ref:`food_waste <food-waste-calibration>` — uses the calibrated
   feed behaviour so that food-bus slack is not contaminated by
   feed-side mismatches.
#. :ref:`food_demand <food-demand-calibration>` — uses the calibrated
   food-waste fractions so that any per-food gap that remains reflects
   a genuine supply / demand mismatch (FAOSTAT QCL vs GDD-IA) and not
   a waste mis-attribution.
#. :ref:`cost <cost-calibration>` — the cost-calibration solve uses
   the calibrated feed, waste, and demand behaviour to extract duals
   that make economic sense. Without the food-demand step, residual
   per-food mismatch leaks into the cost-calibration duals as spurious
   sign (e.g. olive-oil cost driven negative, coffee/cocoa pegged at
   the slack ceiling) and inflates the stability L1 cost downstream.
#. :ref:`supply_response <supply-response-calibration>` — the pinned
   solve measures each group's residual price wedge against the fully
   calibrated feed, waste, demand, and cost behaviour, so the intercepts
   absorb exactly what the earlier steps could not.

The legacy :ref:`stability <prod-stability-calibration>` step is no
longer part of the default chain; run ``tools/calibrate stability``
explicitly for artefact sets still consumed by deviation-penalty
configs.

Running the calibrations
------------------------

Everything is wrapped by ``tools/calibrate``:

.. code-block:: bash

   tools/calibrate              # all, in dependency order
   tools/calibrate feed         # one step (forage + protein feed slack)
   tools/calibrate food_waste
   tools/calibrate food_demand
   tools/calibrate cost
   tools/calibrate supply_response
   tools/calibrate stability    # legacy L1 step, not in the default chain
   tools/calibrate --check      # per-step staleness + provenance, no execution
   tools/calibrate --record     # re-stamp the set as it stands, no execution
   tools/calibrate --base config/<name>.yaml [all|<step>|--check]
                                # calibrate a dedicated set for another config

The wrapper invokes ``tools/smk`` with the matching config and the
appropriate output targets. Any extra flags are passed through, e.g.
``tools/calibrate cost -j8 --slurm``.

Each source and step receives its own deterministic workflow name, such as
``calibration-default-feed``. Its processing and result intermediates are
therefore reusable without being overwritten by the different effective config
of the next calibration step, and ``--check`` can assess every step
independently.

The stability calibration runs locally in-process and is inherently
sequential (each Broyden step depends on the previous solve), so HPC
offloading isn't worthwhile at this size. Each iteration is one paired
solve (baseline + main), and 3–5 iterations are typically enough.

.. _calibration-provenance:

Artefact sets and provenance
----------------------------

Calibration artefacts are only valid for configurations sharing the
structural assumptions they were fit under. Each set therefore carries
a ``provenance.yaml`` stamp of the structural configuration it was
calibrated against (all config leaves except solve-time keys and a
small exempt list; see
``workflow/validation/calibration_provenance.py``), written by
``tools/calibrate`` after each successful run. At workflow start the
active config is compared against the stamp of the set named by
``calibration.source``; a structural mismatch is an error listing the
differing keys.

For multi-cropping, the stamp also records the normalized curated catalog, the
effective observed and greenfield sequence sets, and the MIRCA source year
selected from ``baseline_year``. Editing the catalog, disabling or adding a
sequence, or selecting a different MIRCA release therefore requires a matching
calibration set.

A config with different structural assumptions has three options:

* **Calibrate its own set**: declare ``calibration.source: <name>`` in
  the config and run ``tools/calibrate --base config/<file>.yaml``.
  Artefacts land in ``data/curated/calibration/<name>/``. A fresh set
  is first seeded from the ``default`` set (each calibration solve
  consumes the other steps' artefacts) and then regenerated in
  dependency order.
* **Point at a compatible existing set** via ``calibration.source``.
* **Accept the mismatch** with
  ``calibration.accept_provenance_mismatch: true``, downgrading the
  error to a warning. Only appropriate when calibration fidelity does
  not matter (e.g. the coarse test and tutorial configs).

Solve-time keys (GHG price, health valuation, the deviation-penalty
block, scenario overrides, ...) never invalidate a set; the check fires
only on structural changes. Input and code changes are not captured by the
stamp: ``tools/calibrate --check`` covers those.

Consuming the calibrated values
-------------------------------

All calibration outputs are consumed automatically by the default
workflow when their configuration blocks are enabled (the default):

* ``grazing.grassland_forage_calibration.enabled: true`` loads the
  three forage-side CSVs at solve time (see
  :ref:`grassland-forage-calibration`).
* ``exogenous_feed_calibration.enabled: true`` loads
  ``exogenous_feed.csv`` and injects free per-country generators on
  the monogastric/ruminant protein and ruminant-roughage feed buses (see
  :ref:`exogenous-protein-feed`).
* ``food_demand_calibration.enabled: true`` loads
  ``data/curated/calibration/<source>/food_demand.csv`` at solve time and applies
  each per-food multiplier uniformly to the baseline-diet ``target_mt``
  in ``_match_baseline_to_consume_links`` (see
  :ref:`food-demand-calibration`).
* ``cost_calibration.enabled: true`` loads the cost-correction
  CSVs at build time (see :ref:`cost-calibration-correction`).
* ``deviation_penalty.calibration.enabled: true`` resolves the sentinel
  ``"calibrated"`` on any of
  ``deviation_penalty.{land.crops,land.grassland,feed,diet}.l1_cost`` from
  ``data/curated/calibration/<source>/deviation_penalty.yaml`` at solve time
  (see :ref:`production-stability-bounds` for the config reference).
  Scenarios that want an explicit numeric value simply override the
  sentinel with a number; scenarios that want to scan around the
  calibrated value can leave the sentinel in place and set the
  matching ``l1_cost_factor``.

.. _calibration-feed-step:

Feed calibration
----------------

The feed step generates two parallel sets of corrections from a single
validation solve:

* **Forage corrections** (surplus + deficit on
  ``feed:ruminant_forage:*``). Surplus countries get a per-country
  multiplier on grassland yield and fodder-conversion efficiency;
  deficit countries get an exogenous-forage supply written to
  ``data/curated/calibration/<source>/exogenous_forage.csv``. See
  :ref:`grassland-forage-calibration` in the livestock chapter for the
  algorithm.
* **Protein corrections** (deficit side only, on
  ``feed:monogastric_protein:*`` and ``feed:ruminant_protein:*``). The
  positive slack on each protein feed bus is written to
  ``data/curated/calibration/<source>/exogenous_feed.csv``. See
  :ref:`exogenous-protein-feed` for what real-world sources it stands
  in for.

Both rules read the same solved validation network. The relevant
Snakemake rules are ``compute_grassland_calibration`` (forage) and
``compute_exogenous_feed_calibration`` (protein and roughage), both in
``workflow/rules/animals.smk``. ``generate: true`` lives in
``config/calibration/feed.yaml`` and is ``false`` everywhere else,
which breaks the otherwise circular dependency.

.. _food-waste-calibration:

Food-waste calibration
----------------------

See the food-loss-and-waste discussion in :doc:`food_processing` for
the underlying SDG 12.3 derivation. Rule:
``compute_food_waste_calibration`` in ``workflow/rules/diet.smk``;
``generate: true`` lives in ``config/calibration/food_waste.yaml``.

.. _food-demand-calibration:

Food-demand calibration
-----------------------

Even after the food-waste step closes the **group-level** gap between
FAOSTAT-derived supply and GDD-IA-derived intake, per-food residuals
remain: foods within a group can be jointly consistent at the group
total while individual foods are systematically over- or
under-demanded. The food-demand calibration absorbs this residual into
a per-food global multiplier on the baseline-diet ``target_mt``.

The multiplier is derived from the global food-bus balance reported by
an uncalibrated validation-mode solve (``scenario: uncalibrated`` in
``config/calibration/food_demand.yaml``, with
``food_demand_calibration.enabled: false`` and ``generate: true`` so
the solve does not read the calibration file it is about to write,
following the
:ref:`canonical pattern <calibration-enabled-generate-pattern>`):

.. math::

   m_f = \mathrm{clip}\!\left(
       \frac{C_f}{C_f + N_f},\ [m_{\min},\ m_{\max}]
   \right)

where :math:`C_f = \sum_c p^0_{\ell_{c,f}}` is total food-consumption
flow for food :math:`f` and
:math:`N_f = \mathrm{slack}^{+}_{f} - \mathrm{slack}^{-}_{f}` is the
net food-bus slack on the two ``slack_positive_food`` /
``slack_negative_food`` generators (positive slack = LP had to invoke a
shortage filler, so demand was too high and the multiplier shrinks;
negative slack = LP absorbed excess, so demand was too low and the
multiplier grows). Both quantities are summed over countries for each
food. The clip bounds (``min_multiplier`` / ``max_multiplier`` in the
config) default to ``[0.5, 2.0]``; they are tight on purpose so that an
out-of-range value flags a structural data issue rather than being
silently absorbed.

At solve time ``_match_baseline_to_consume_links`` (in
``workflow/scripts/solve_model/core.py``) applies the multiplier
uniformly across all countries for each food when
``food_demand_calibration.enabled`` is true.

Rule: ``compute_food_demand_calibration`` in
``workflow/rules/diet.smk``. Script:
``workflow/scripts/compute_food_demand_calibration.py``.

.. _cost-calibration:

Cost calibration
----------------

The cost calibration is a two-step paired solve:

**Step 1 (consumer-value extraction).** A baseline solve with
``enforce_baseline_diet: true`` extracts food-bus duals to build the
piecewise consumer-utility blocks used downstream. Step 1 enables hard
production-stability bounds at **+/-20 %** for crops, grassland, and
animals; this prevents the LP from idealising supply patterns and
pushing the consumer-value duals below realistic supply cost, which in
earlier versions forced step 2 to absorb a large negative correction.
The +/-20 % band is loose enough to accommodate the structural
FAOSTAT-vs-FBS mismatch carried by most foods. For the small set of
foods whose mismatch still exceeds the band (buckwheat, plantain,
coffee, tea, olive-oil), a file-level
``validation.slack_marginal_cost: 5.0`` ($5 000/t) override caps the
slack-driven duals at the upper end of realistic wholesale prices --
instead of the default ~$50 000/t slack ceiling -- while leaving
enough headroom for legitimately high-value foods.

**Step 2 (cost-correction extraction).** A second solve activates the
piecewise utility built in step 1 and tightens production stability to
**+/-1 %**. The dual :math:`\mu^+_\ell - \mu^-_\ell` on each tight
production-stability constraint indicates how much the link's marginal
cost would need to shift for the observed allocation to be
cost-optimal; the per-group median becomes an additive correction. See
:ref:`cost-calibration-correction` for how the corrections are applied
at build time. Single-crop links are aggregated to per-(crop, country)
corrections, while multi-cropping links are extracted separately to
per-(combination, country) bundle corrections because their duals price
one joint cycle bundle rather than one constituent crop.

Rule: ``extract_cost_calibration`` in ``workflow/rules/crops.smk``.
Script: ``workflow/scripts/extract_cost_calibration.py``. The two
scenarios (``baseline`` and ``calibration``) live in
``config/calibration/cost.yaml``.

.. _supply-response-calibration:

Supply-response intercept calibration
-------------------------------------

The default production-anchoring mechanism is the set of convex
piecewise-linear supply curves described under :ref:`Supply Response
<supply-response-curves>`. Their calibration is the standard two-phase
positive-mathematical-programming procedure: one solve with every curve
group held at its observed activity behind an elastic pin
(``supply_response.pin_baseline``), whose pinning duals -- the per-group
price wedges between marginal value and accounting cost -- are written
to ``supply_response.csv`` and fed back as curve intercepts. With the
intercepts in place the observed allocation satisfies the optimality
conditions of the unpinned model and is reproduced exactly, with no
hard constraints and no tuned deviation target; the configured
elasticity governs only the response away from the calibrated point.

The pinned solve runs under the base config's own operating regime with
the policy dials at neutral (no GHG price, demand left to whatever
drives it in ordinary solves). Exact reproduction therefore holds for
unpriced solves of the same config, and a priced solve shows the pure
elasticity-governed response. Wedges are regime-specific: intercepts fit
under one demand system misprice production under another, so a config
that changes the demand side materially needs its own artefact set.

Groups whose reference activity is inconsistent with the model's hard
constraints (land or water availability, feed balances) use pin slack
and get their intercept censored at ``pin_slack_cost``; they are flagged
in the calibration log and carry a nonzero ``slack`` column in the
artefact, which is the place to look when a group refuses to sit at its
baseline.

The intercepts are keyed by curve group, so they are specific to both
the ``granularity`` setting and -- at ``link`` granularity -- the exact
model structure. A solve against intercepts from a structurally
different build fails loudly on the missing group keys; regenerate with
``tools/calibrate supply_response`` (or ``--base config/<name>.yaml``
for a dedicated artefact set).

Rule: ``calibrate_supply_response`` in
``workflow/rules/supply_response.smk``. Script:
``workflow/scripts/calibrate_supply_response.py``. Config:
``config/calibration/supply_response.yaml``.

.. _prod-stability-calibration:

Production-stability L1 calibration (legacy)
--------------------------------------------

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

A pure cost-minimisation solve of a global food system model is free
to reorganise production arbitrarily: if a country produces wheat more
cheaply than its neighbour, the optimiser will shift the neighbour's
entire wheat output across the border. This is unrealistic — real
production patterns reflect a long tail of frictions (rotations,
contracts, infrastructure, labour, insurance, policy) that the model
does not represent. Without a counterweight, the optimal allocation
diverges sharply from observed production and analyses that build on
top (marginal-cost attribution, counterfactual comparisons, sensitivity
analysis) become different to relate to the current food system.

The model therefore adds a **production-stability penalty** (see
:ref:`production-stability-bounds` for the full configuration reference)
that discourages departures from the observed-year baseline. Every crop,
grassland and animal-feed production link :math:`\ell` carries a linear
:math:`L_1` term in the objective,

.. math::

   \sum_{\ell \in \text{crop,grass}} \ell^c_1 \cdot
   |x_\ell - \bar x_\ell|
   \;+\;
   \sum_{\ell \in \text{animal}} \ell^a_1 \cdot
   |x_\ell - \bar x_\ell|,

where :math:`\bar x_\ell` is the baseline activity of the link (area
in Mha for crops / grassland, feed use in Mt DM for animals) and
:math:`\ell^c_1`, :math:`\ell^a_1` are the two penalty coefficients
calibrated here. The :math:`L_1` form is convenient: it can be
implemented linearly so the LP stays an LP.

Why two coefficients?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Land activity and animal-feed activity are measured in different units
and have different baseline totals (roughly 4,000 Mha of land vs
6,500 Mt DM of feed). A single shared coefficient would penalise one
axis much more strongly than the other. Splitting the penalty into a
crop/grassland coefficient :math:`\ell^c_1` (bn USD per Mha of
deviation) and an animal-feed coefficient :math:`\ell^a_1` (bn USD per
Mt DM) lets us tune each axis independently.

Calibration target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We pick :math:`(\ell^c_1, \ell^a_1)` so that the optimal solution
exhibits **~5 %** total deviation on each axis (summed absolute
deviation divided by the baseline total). The 5 % target is a
compromise: large enough that the optimiser can still express
meaningful shifts in response to scenarios (carbon prices, diet
changes, yield shocks), small enough that the resulting production
pattern stays recognisably close to observed production and
interpretation remains tractable.

Formally the calibration solves

.. math::

   \min_{(\ell^c_1, \ell^a_1)} \quad
   \big\lVert \text{land\_dev}(\ell^c_1, \ell^a_1) - 5\,\%\big\rVert,
   \quad
   \big\lVert \text{feed\_dev}(\ell^c_1, \ell^a_1) - 5\,\%\big\rVert.

Broyden iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deviation map

.. math::

   F : (\ell^c_1, \ell^a_1) \;\longmapsto\;
   (\text{land\_dev}, \text{feed\_dev})

is monotone and near-affine in log-log coordinates (raising
:math:`\ell^c_1` mainly tightens land deviation, raising
:math:`\ell^a_1` mainly tightens feed deviation, with small cross
coupling). Calibration is therefore a 2-D root-finding problem,
solved with **Broyden's quasi-Newton method** on
:math:`x = (\log \ell^c_1, \log \ell^a_1)` with residual
:math:`r(x) = (\log(\text{land\_dev}/t),\, \log(\text{feed\_dev}/t))`.
A trust-region cap of :math:`\lvert \Delta x \rvert_\infty \le \log 2`
prevents single-step overshoot near the zero-baseline growth caps.

Each iteration is one paired solve (baseline with
``enforce_baseline_diet=true`` to derive consumer values, then main
with piecewise utility active). Convergence is typically reached in
3–5 iterations from a cold start and 1–2 from a warm start (the
existing calibrated YAML is auto-detected and used as the seed). The
initial Jacobian is :math:`\mathrm{diag}(-1, -1)`, which is the exact
log-log slope for a relationship of the form
:math:`\text{dev} \propto 1/\ell_1`.

Convergence target: :math:`\lvert \log(\text{dev}/t) \rvert_\infty
< 0.02`, i.e. all calibrated deviations within +/-2 % of the target.
The calibrated coefficients are written to
``data/curated/calibration/<source>/deviation_penalty.yaml`` under
``l1_costs.<component>`` and resolved at solve time wherever the
sentinel ``"calibrated"`` appears in
``deviation_penalty.{land.crops,land.grassland,feed,diet}.l1_cost`` (see
:ref:`production-stability-bounds`).

A per-iteration diagnostic CSV is written to
``results/{name}/calibration/deviation_penalty_trace.csv`` with the
per-component iterate, achieved deviations, and residual norm for each
step.

The set of components driven simultaneously is configured via
``deviation_penalty.calibration.components`` (default
``[cropland, grassland, feed]``). Diet calibration is available as an
opt-in ``components: [cropland, grassland, feed, diet]`` profile for
specific investigations
where the priced optimum would otherwise reshuffle the diet
substantially.

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rule: ``calibrate_deviation_penalty`` in
``workflow/rules/deviation_penalty.smk``. Script:
``workflow/scripts/calibrate_deviation_penalty.py``.

The calibrated L1 centre also defines the reference regime for the GSA
scenario groups (``gsa``, ``gsa-l1-low``, ``gsa-l1-high``); see
:ref:`sensitivity-prod-stability-cost`.

Staleness detection
-------------------

``tools/smk`` prints a one-line reminder when any file under
``data/curated/`` (excluding ``data/curated/calibration/`` itself) is
newer than the oldest file in ``data/curated/calibration/``. This is a
cheap mtime heuristic and may produce false positives after
``git pull`` (because checkout touches mtimes); for the authoritative
answer run

.. code-block:: bash

   tools/calibrate --check

which reports ``[up-to-date]`` / ``[STALE]`` per step, listing what moved.
Set ``SMK_SKIP_CALIBRATION_HINT=1`` to silence the reminder in scripted
contexts.

A step is stale when re-running it would change its artefacts, which depends
only on inputs from *outside* the artefact set. ``tools/calibrate`` therefore
writes a ``fingerprint.yaml`` next to the artefacts, recording SHA-256 digests
of

* every external leaf of the step's Snakemake DAG (curated and bundled data,
  manually downloaded sources, the ``build_model`` package),
* the rule files and scripts the DAG runs,
* the step config, hashed after a YAML round-trip so comment and formatting
  edits do not register,
* the artefacts the step wrote, so one edited or checked out behind the
  chain's back is reported rather than silently trusted.

The DAG is rebuilt on each check, so a dependency that a rule or code change
adds or drops is picked up straight away. Because the fingerprint ignores the
artefact set's own contents, re-running one step never marks its successors
stale, and mtime changes alone (a ``git checkout``, a ``touch``) never do
either.

Editing any rule file or script in a step's DAG marks it stale, including
changes that cannot affect the result. When you know a code change is inert,
re-stamp the set without solving:

.. code-block:: bash

   tools/calibrate --record

This asserts that the artefacts on disk are current, so only use it when they
demonstrably are.
