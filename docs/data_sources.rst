**Key features**:
  * **Multi-output pathways**: Multiple rows with the same pathway ID represent co-products from a single processing operation
  * **Alternative pathways**: Different pathways for the same crop (e.g., white flour vs. wholemeal flour) let the model choose optimal processing routes
  * **Mass balance**: Sum of conversion factors per pathway must be ≤ 1.0, with remainder representing unavoidable losses
  * **Validation**: Model validates mass balance constraints when building the network

**Primary source**: FAO Nutrient Conversion Table for Supply Utilization Accounts (2024), sheet 03. Additional factors from literature for specific crops.

**License**: Data in this file is derived from FAO SUA 2024 (© FAO 2024, non-commercial use with attribution) and other cited sources. The pathway structure and organization is original to this project.

**Usage**: ``workflow/scripts/build_model.py`` reads this file and creates multi-output PyPSA Links for each pathway, with efficiencies adjusted for country-specific food loss and waste factors.

**Maintenance**: This is a hand-written configuration file that users should review and potentially customize for their analysis. When adding new crops or food products, corresponding pathways must be added to this file with appropriate conversion factors and source citations.

Nutritional Data
----------------

USDA FoodData Central
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service

**Description**: Comprehensive food composition database providing nutritional data for foods. This project uses the SR Legacy (Standard Reference) database, which contains laboratory-analyzed nutrient data for over 7,000 foods.

**Access**: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/ (web interface) or via REST API

**API Documentation**: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html

**License**: Public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0). No permission needed for use, but USDA requests attribution.

**Citation**: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. FoodData Central. fdc.nal.usda.gov.

**Usage**: Nutritional composition of model foods (protein, carbohydrates, fat, energy)

**Workflow retrieval**: Optional via ``retrieve_usda_nutrition`` rule (using the API with included API key)

**Configuration**: Set ``data.usda.retrieve_nutrition: true`` in config to fetch fresh data. By default, the repository includes pre-fetched data in ``data/nutrition.csv``.

**API Key**: The repository includes a shared API key for convenience. Users can optionally obtain their own API key (free, instant signup) at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup and update the ``data.usda.api_key`` value in the config.

The mapping from model foods to USDA FoodData Central IDs is maintained in ``data/usda_food_mapping.csv``. This file maps internal food names (e.g., "flour (white)", "rice", "chicken meat") to specific FDC IDs from the SR Legacy database (e.g., wheat flour white all-purpose enriched, white rice cooked, chicken breast raw).

FAO Nutrient Conversion Table for SUA (2024)

**License**: © FAO 2024. Reuse for private study, research, teaching, or other non-commercial purposes is allowed with acknowledgement of FAO; translation, adaptation, resale, and commercial uses require prior permission via copyright@fao.org.

**Workflow retrieval**: Automatically downloaded to ``data/downloads/fao_nutrient_conversion_table_for_sua_2024.xlsx`` by the ``download_fao_nutrient_conversion_table`` rule in ``workflow/rules/retrieve.smk``.

**Usage**: Contains data on edible portion of foods as well as water content. ``workflow/scripts/prepare_fao_edible_portion.py`` reads sheet ``03`` to export edible portion coefficients and water content (g/100g) for configured crops into ``processing/{name}/fao_edible_portion.csv``; ``workflow/scripts/build_model.py`` combines these with crop yields to rescale dry harvests to fresh edible food mass. Note that for certain crops (grains: rice, barley, oat, buckwheat; oil crops: rapeseed, olive; sugar crops: sugarcane, sugarbeet), the script overrides FAO's coefficients to 1.0 to match the model's yield units, with processing losses handled separately.

Mock and Placeholder Data
