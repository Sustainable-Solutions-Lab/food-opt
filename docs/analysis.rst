Analysis
========

This section describes post-hoc analyses that can be performed on solved models
to extract insights about production, consumption, and the environmental and
health impacts of food systems.

.. _statistics-extraction:

Statistics Extraction
---------------------

The statistics extraction produces standardized Parquet files summarizing key model
outputs. These files provide a consistent interface for downstream analysis and
visualization, extracting data from the solved PyPSA network using actual
dispatch flows rather than capacity-based estimates.

Running the Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   # Extract all statistics for a scenario
   tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml -- \
       results/{name}/analysis/scen-default/crop_production.parquet

   # Or request any downstream plot to trigger extraction automatically

Output Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All statistics are written to ``results/{name}/analysis/scen-{scenario}/``.

**crop_production.parquet** — Crop production by crop, region, and country

.. csv-table::
   :header: Column, Type, Unit, Description

   ``crop``, string, —, "Crop identifier (e.g., ``wheat``, ``maize``, ``grassland``)"
   ``region``, string, —, "Production region identifier"
   ``country``, string, —, "ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code"
   ``production_mt``, float, Mt, "Production quantity in megatonnes"

Sources include single-crop production links, grassland production, and
multicropping links (where multiple crops share the same land).

**land_use.parquet** — Land allocation by crop, region, resource class, and water supply

.. csv-table::
   :header: Column, Type, Unit, Description

   ``crop``, string, —, "Crop identifier"
   ``region``, string, —, "Production region identifier"
   ``resource_class``, int, —, "Land suitability class (0 = least productive, higher integers = more productive; number of classes set by ``aggregation.resource_class_quantiles``)"
   ``water_supply``, string, —, "Water regime (``rainfed`` or ``irrigated``)"
   ``country``, string, —, "ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code"
   ``area_mha``, float, Mha, "Cultivated area in million hectares"

For multicropping systems, land area is attributed to individual crops
proportionally by their yield (efficiency) on that land.

**animal_production.parquet** — Livestock product output by product and country

.. csv-table::
   :header: Column, Type, Unit, Description

   ``product``, string, —, "Product identifier (e.g., ``dairy``, ``meat-cattle``, ``eggs``)"
   ``country``, string, —, "ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code"
   ``production_mt``, float, Mt, "Production quantity in megatonnes"

**food_consumption.parquet** — Food consumption and macronutrients by food and country

.. csv-table::
   :header: Column, Type, Unit, Description

   ``food``, string, —, "Food identifier (e.g., ``wheat``, ``bread``, ``beef``)"
   ``country``, string, —, "ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code"
   ``consumption_mt``, float, Mt, "Total consumption in megatonnes"
   ``protein_mt``, float, Mt, "Protein content in megatonnes"
   ``carb_mt``, float, Mt, "Carbohydrate content in megatonnes"
   ``fat_mt``, float, Mt, "Fat content in megatonnes"
   ``cal_pj``, float, PJ, "Energy content in petajoules"
   ``consumption_g_per_person_day``, float, g/person/day, "Per-capita daily consumption"
   ``protein_g_per_person_day``, float, g/person/day, "Per-capita daily protein intake"
   ``carb_g_per_person_day``, float, g/person/day, "Per-capita daily carbohydrate intake"
   ``fat_g_per_person_day``, float, g/person/day, "Per-capita daily fat intake"
   ``cal_kcal_per_person_day``, float, kcal/person/day, "Per-capita daily energy intake"

**food_group_consumption.parquet** — Consumption aggregated by food group and country

Has the same columns as ``food_consumption.parquet``, except with ``food_group``
instead of ``food``. Food groups aggregate related foods (e.g., ``cereals``,
``fruits``, ``red_meat``) for higher-level analysis.

**feed_by_source.parquet** — Animal feed consumption decomposed by supply source

Each row attributes a portion of an animal-class draw from a feed-category bus
back to the upstream supply on that bus, using the bus's source mix as
attribution weights. All quantities are on a dry-matter basis (every feed bus
in the model is uniformly DM). Trade flows between countries net out at the
global level for a given feed_category and are excluded from the source list;
attribution is to primary (non-trade) inflows.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Column", "Type", "Unit", "Description"

   ``product``, str, –, "Raw animal product name (e.g., ``meat-cattle``, ``dairy``, ``eggs``)"
   ``animal``, str, –, "Animal-class display label (e.g., ``Cattle``, ``Sheep``)"
   ``feed_category``, str, –, "Raw feed category at the animal_production input (``ruminant_forage``, ``monogastric_low_quality``, etc.)"
   ``source_key``, str, –, "Stable internal source identifier; one of ``grassland``, ``residue``, ``fodder_crop``, ``grain_crop``, ``protein_crop``, ``food_byproduct``, ``exog_forage_cal``, ``exog_protein_cal``, ``exog_browse``, ``exog_swill``, ``exog_other``"
   ``source``, str, –, "Human-readable source label (e.g., ``Crop residues``, ``Exog. browse / leaves``)"
   ``mt_dm``, float, Mt DM, "Attributed feed mass (dry matter)"

``feed_by_category.parquet`` and ``feed_by_animal.parquet`` are coarser views
(by feed category alone, or by animal alone) that drop the source breakdown.

**water_metrics.parquet** — Irrigation water use and scarcity by region

Reported on a consumption basis; see :doc:`water` for the underlying model and
the caveat that reported depletion is only meaningful at
``water.temporal_resolution`` > 1.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Column", "Type", "Unit", "Description"

   ``region``, str, –, "Model region"
   ``withdrawn_mm3``, float, Mm³, "Irrigation consumption drawn from the regional pool (all sources)"
   ``withdrawal_reported_mm3``, float, Mm³, "Estimated physical withdrawal (consumption / consumed fraction C/W)"
   ``scarcity_mm3_eq``, float, Mm³ world-eq, "Accumulated AWARE scarcity of the CF-carrying draw"
   ``groundwater_renewable_mm3``, float, Mm³, "Renewable groundwater drawn"
   ``groundwater_depletion_mm3``, float, Mm³, "Non-renewable groundwater mined"
   ``mean_cf``, float, –, "Draw-weighted mean AWARE CF of the CF-carrying draw (NaN where none)"

Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Load statistics in Python for custom analysis:

.. code-block:: python

   import pandas as pd

   # Load crop production
   production = pd.read_parquet("results/opt/analysis/scen-default/crop_production.parquet")

   # Total wheat production globally
   wheat_total = production[production["crop"] == "wheat"]["production_mt"].sum()

   # Load consumption with per-capita values
   consumption = pd.read_parquet("results/opt/analysis/scen-default/food_consumption.parquet")

   # Average per-capita protein intake
   avg_protein = consumption["protein_g_per_person_day"].mean()

GHG Intensity
-------------

The GHG intensity analysis computes greenhouse gas emissions attributable to
each unit of food consumed. This provides a consumption-centric view of
impacts, tracing emissions through trade and processing networks back to
production.

**GHG intensity** measures the greenhouse gas emissions per unit of food
consumed (kg CO₂e per kg food). Unlike production-based accounting, this
consumption-attributed metric traces emissions through the entire supply chain:
if wheat is grown in one country, milled into flour, and consumed in another,
the emissions from farming, processing, and transport are all attributed to the
final consumption.

GHG Attribution Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GHG attribution uses a flow-based approach via sparse matrix algebra.
The network of production, processing, and trade links forms a directed graph
where each node (bus) receives material from upstream and passes it downstream.
Emissions occur at production links (e.g., fertilizer N₂O, enteric CH₄).

The key insight is that emission intensity propagates through the network:
the intensity at any bus equals its direct emissions plus the weighted average
of upstream intensities. This gives a linear system:

.. math::

   \rho = e + M \rho

where :math:`\rho` is the vector of emission intensities at each bus,
:math:`e` is the vector of direct emission contributions, and :math:`M` is
the weighted adjacency matrix (flow fractions). Solving
:math:`(I - M)\rho = e` yields the consumption-attributed intensity at each
food bus.

Running the GHG Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   # Extract consumption-attributed GHG intensity for a scenario
   tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml -- \
       results/{name}/analysis/scen-default/ghg_attribution.parquet

      ``food_group``, string, —, "Food group"
      ``consumption_mt``, float, Mt, "Consumption quantity"
      ``ghg_kgco2e_per_kg``, float, kgCO2e/kg, "GHG intensity"
      ``ghg_usd_per_t``, float, USD/t, "Monetized GHG damage"

      ``food_group``, string, —, "Food group"
      ``ghg_mtco2eq``, float, MtCO2eq, "Total emissions attributed to consumption"

Net Emissions
-------------

The net emissions extraction reads the solved network's emission aggregation
links directly, providing the absolute net GHG balance including negative
emissions from spared land sequestration.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Extract net emissions for a scenario
   tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml -- \
       results/{name}/analysis/scen-default/net_emissions.parquet

``results/{name}/analysis/scen-{scenario}/net_emissions.parquet``
   Net GHG emissions by gas and source category:

   .. csv-table::
      :header: Column, Type, Unit, Description

      ``gas``, string, —, "Gas type (co2, ch4, n2o)"
      ``source``, string, —, "Emission source category"
      ``mtco2eq``, float, MtCO2eq, "Emissions in CO2 equivalents"

Health Impacts
--------------

The health impacts analysis computes marginal years of life lost (YLL) per
unit of food consumed, based on dose-response curve derivatives at current
population intake levels.

**Health impact** measures the years of life lost (YLL) per unit of food
consumed. This is computed as the marginal effect—the derivative of the
dose-response curve at current population intake levels. Foods with protective
effects (fruits, vegetables, legumes) have negative values, while foods
associated with health risks (processed meat, excess red meat) have positive
values.

Health Attribution Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Health impacts are computed by evaluating the slope of the piecewise-linear
dose-response curves at current intake levels. For each (health cluster, risk
factor) pair:

1. Current per-capita intake is computed from consumption flows and population
2. The slope of the log-relative-risk curve at this intake is determined
3. The chain rule converts this to YLL per unit intake change:

   .. math::

      \frac{d(\text{YLL})}{d(\text{intake})} =
      \frac{\text{YLL}_\text{base}}{\text{RR}_\text{ref}} \cdot \text{RR} \cdot
      \frac{d(\log \text{RR})}{d(\text{intake})}

4. Units are converted from YLL per g/capita/day to YLL per Mt food

The result captures how marginal changes in consumption affect population
health outcomes, accounting for where each country currently sits on the
dose-response curve.

Sample Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following figures show consumption-weighted global averages of GHG
intensity and health impacts by food group:

.. figure:: https://github.com/Sustainable-Solutions-Lab/GLADE/releases/download/doc-figures/analysis_marginal_ghg.png
   :alt: Bar chart showing GHG intensity by food group
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

   Global average GHG intensity by food group (consumption-weighted). Animal
   products (red meat, dairy) show the highest emissions per kg, while
   plant-based foods generally have lower intensities.

.. _fig-analysis-yll:

   :alt: Bar chart showing health impact by food group
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

   Global average health impact by food group (consumption-weighted). Negative
   values indicate protective effects (fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole
   grains), while positive values indicate health risks. The magnitude reflects
   the marginal impact at current global intake levels.

Generating Global Average Plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   # Generate global average plots
   tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml -- \
       results/{name}/plots/scen-default/marginal_ghg_global.pdf \
       results/{name}/plots/scen-default/marginal_yll_global.pdf

Objective Breakdown
-------------------

The objective breakdown analysis extracts the cost components that make up the
model's objective function, grouped into high-level categories. This enables
analysis of how different cost drivers contribute to the total system cost.

Running the Objective Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   # Extract objective breakdown for a scenario
   tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml -- \
       results/{name}/analysis/scen-default/objective_breakdown.parquet

Output file:

``results/{name}/analysis/scen-{scenario}/objective_breakdown.parquet``
   Single-row Parquet file with cost categories in billion USD:

   .. csv-table::
      :header: Column, Type, Unit, Description

      ``crop_production``, float, bn USD, "Land use and yield-related costs"
      ``trade``, float, bn USD, "Import/export costs"
      ``fertilizer``, float, bn USD, "Synthetic fertilizer costs"

      ``biomass_exports``, float, bn USD, "Revenue from biomass exports (negative)"
      ``biomass_routing``, float, bn USD, "Internal biomass flow costs"
      ``health_burden``, float, bn USD, "Health costs from YLL"
      ``ghg_cost``, float, bn USD, "Emissions costs"
      ``emissions_aggregation``, float, bn USD, "Links aggregating emissions to the GHG bus (usually zero)"
      ``land_use``, float, bn USD, "Land-use and land-conversion link costs"
      ``water``, float, bn USD, "Water stores"
      ``water_scarcity_cost``, float, bn USD, "Priced water-scarcity footprint (when enabled)"
      ``groundwater_depletion_cost``, float, bn USD, "Priced groundwater depletion (when enabled)"
      ``slack_penalties``, float, bn USD, "Constraint-violation penalties (ideally zero)"
      ``resource_supply``, float, bn USD, "Land and resource generators (usually zero)"
      ``nutrient_tracking``, float, bn USD, "Nutrient stores (usually zero)"
      ``production_stability``, float, bn USD, "L1/quadratic deviation penalty plus bounded cost corrections (legacy anchoring)"
      ``supply_response``, float, bn USD, "Deviation cost of the market-response supply curves"
      ``demand_response``, float, bn USD, "Forgone-utility cost of the market-response demand curves"
      ``diet_stability``, float, bn USD, "Diet deviation penalty (when enabled)"

   Zero-valued categories are dropped from the output, so a given file
   contains only the columns active in that solve.

The script validates that extracted categories sum to the model's reported
objective value and raises an error if they don't match (within 1% tolerance).
It also raises errors for unrecognized component patterns to ensure the
analysis is updated when the model structure changes.

      observed values, using slack variables to reveal data inconsistencies.
